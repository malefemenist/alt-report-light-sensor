    <p>Computer Alt 1- light sensor</p>

    <p>Exam number- 122583</p>

    <p>Investigation and Planning</p>

    <p>
      My class started this project in late December with the knowledge that we
      must create a home automation system involving an immersive, informative
      website and two micro bits that communicate using radio transmission.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;I started my research by viewing various micro bit websites to help
      come up with some ideas.
    </p>

    <p>Examples:</p>

    </p>

    <p>
      Due to my somewhat basic understanding of how to creatively and
      effectively use a micro bit, I did not want to overshoot and try to tackle
      a project that was too complicated. But I still had a strong desire to
      create a unique, practical and accessible device for users
    </p>

    <p>
      I originally wanted to create a home sound system that would be able to
      scan Spotify codes and transmit the said song to the homes sound system.
      One micro bit would collect the codes and transmit them to the other micro
      bit which would then play them.
    </p>

    <p>
      I ended up scrapping this concept as i found it extremely difficult and
      complex to achieve. I am nonetheless happy that I still attempted it
      though as I feel it really showed me to keep my ambition in check and to
      stay realistic.
    </p>

    <p>
      My second idea was a soil moisture sensor that would track the soil
      moisture and play an alarm to notify the user if the moisture level was
      low. This attempt was much more of a success than the previous as I
      actually carried over much of the same code into my final project. This
      idea really helped to shape my final result and it helped me come to my
      final conclusion but I had to scrap it due to similarities with other
      projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      I eventually landed at my end project which is a light sensor that sends
      out an alarm to notify the user when not enough light is being absorbed.
      &ldquo;The emitter &ldquo;micro bit tracks the level of light and when it
      falls below a value of 10 a signal is sent to the &ldquo;receiver&rdquo;
      micro bit to play the alarm.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe this final Iteration scratches all of the boxes that I was
      searching for in my project. It is accessible, not too complex and
      practical.
    </p>

    <p>
      I identified technology such as thingspeak and iot to help bring my
      project to fruition.
    </p>

    <p>
      7I believe my project is extremely accessible and inclusive on an ethical
      and social side. This device is open for all to use and there are no
      boundaries stopping anyone from using it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe my project to be extremely inclusive with the 7 aspects of
      universal design. My project is flexible, there is a high tolerance for
      error as the project requires little input from users, this low input also
      means low physical effort. Every user will get the same experience and
      means from the project it is easy to access and use for all types of
      users.
    </p>

    <p>
      Potential stakeholders would largely involve the plant business as this
      project would be incredibly helpful in ensuring your plants get a healthy
      amount of light.
    </p>

    <p>Design</p>

    <p>
      We were given the option to either pick a waterfall or agile approach
      towards our project. A waterfall approach is much more linear and
      segmented whereas an agile approach gives u much more flexibility as you
      able to tackle multiple concepts at once. Both approaches have their
      strengths but I ultimately chose to do an agile approach as I really
      enjoyed the freedom and versatility that it brought with it. I really felt
      like it allowed all the different elements of my project to interact with
      each other more.
    </p>

    <p>
      We chose micro bit as our embedded system as it was easily accessible to
      us in our school but we were aware of other options such as raspberry pi
      and chibiOS.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to my extensive preplanning, I was already aware of what hardware
      would be needed for my project. Crocodile clips, two USB cables, two micro
      bits, thingspeak, light sensor and a sound system.
    </p>

    <p>
      For software I coded on the micro bit website as it is the best way to
      code data into a micro bit.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project is mainly targeted towards user who own plants as I developed
      it with the intention of it being able to alert the owner when the plant
      wasn&rsquo;t getting enough sun but technically this project could be used
      for a multitude of different outputs.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe my website design meets the requirements as I have included a
      multitude of important features such as a data capture form, validation
      and I am displaying information from fireball into the website.
    </p>

    <p>Implementation and Testing</p>

    <p>
      I went through 3 crucial stages of development during the making of my
      project Brainstorming/research, conceptualising and execution. My project
      went through 3 separate iterations as I attempted to find a concept that
      fit me the best. The project I first started with in late December was
      extremely different compared to the project I handed in on March 28th. One
      of the biggest issues I had was mostly centred around my ambition as I
      constantly tried to create a project that I just didn&rsquo;t have the
      time recourses or skill to create. The other major issue I ran into was my
      2nd iterations similarity to another student&rsquo;s project, this forced
      me to revaluate my project as I had to search for a new concept that would
      have to use the majority of my already existing code.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the first block of code in my light sensor, it first sets the
      micro bit into red set group 1(this is how the two micro bits will
      communicate) it then connects to the local Wi-Fi and collects thing speaks
      API key, doing this allows thingspeak to connect to the project allowing
      me to see analytics, finally the micro bit will play a series of leds to
      show the user if the thingspeak is connected or not.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the most substantial block of code for the light sensor micro bit.
      If the light level falls below a value of 10 it displays a smiley face led
      and sends a radio signal to all other micro bits present in radio group
      1(alarm micro bit). If the light level stays above 10 it displays a frowns
      face led. Finally, it uploads all this data to thingspeak.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the code for the 2nd micro bit(alarm). The code starts off by
      placing this micro bit in the same radio set group as the light sensor.
      This micro bit then receives the radio signal sent out from the light
      sensor; it then plays a led to clarify to the user. It then plays a loud
      alarm and then clears the screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      I extensively tested out every individual piece of code in the project. I
      feel like I did not make many changes due to testing as I had already
      planned out the project and most of the code worked without any issues.
      The only code I found trouble with was the thingspeak which I had many
      issues with trying to get it to work.
    </p>

    <p>Evaluation</p>

    <p>
      &bull;Week 1: I began to research resources and concepts that would be
      needed for this upcoming project. I came to the conclusion that my project
      needed to be accessible and practical for users.
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull;Week 2: during this time period I finalised my first concept for the
      project (Spotify codes) but it started to become clear to me that my
      ambitions may have started to become a hindrance as I found it hard to
      slow down and think more realistically about what I could actually
      accomplish.
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull;Week 3: This was the most important week during the development of
      my project as this was the week where I finally slowed down and I realised
      how unattainable my current trajectory was.
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull;With this knowledge in hand, I restarted my project with the goal to
      create a much more attainable and simpler project.
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull;Week 4: Newly invigorated with the restart of my project I was able
      to quickly finalise the second concept for my project.
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull;I would later run into a seemingly major setback when I found out
      this concept was too similar to a similar one being worked on,
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull;Week 5: After taking a weekend off to Brainstorm ideas for my
      project I came across an article that played a monumental part in helping
      me form my final concept.
    </p>

    <p>(References)</p>

    <p>
      &bull;After reading this I was able to create my final concept (a light
      sensor that sends out an alarm to notify the user when not enough light is
      being absorbed).
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull; Week 6: With the knowledge I was able to gather in the previous
      week I set out on actually coding and creating my light sensor
    </p>

    <p>
      &bull;Week 7: I spent this last week adding thinkspeak to my project and
      finishing my report.
